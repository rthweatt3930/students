## Background & Interests
I am currently a Junior at UT Knoxville, but my hometown is Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
I've studied Computer Science for about 5 years, and Data Science for about 3 years, including an internship as a data analyst.
Some languages and tools I have become familiar with in that time include:
- C++
- Java
- Python
- SQL
- Google BigQuery
- Microsoft PowerBI
- Godot (game engine)

I am a passionate Christian as well as a huge Titans and Volunteers fan. A more recent interest of mine is writing country songs, and then feeding those lyrics into an AI that can make a song out of them. I've written 24 songs split into two albums, but as of writing this, only one is public, but I have posted it on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=atx7Pj0GwETv7S2Y) on a channel named [TweetsTunes](https://www.youtube.com/@TweetsTuness/featured).
