# Multi-Platform Social Media Poster
## Concept
A platform that a user can connect multiple social media accounts (Instagram, Snapchat, X, Facebook, etc.) and make a post that can
be shared on all of them at once (another version of this would be posting music to Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Music simultaneously).

## What Is Being Solved?
The problem being solved is having to individually make posts on each platform. If it is a highly involved post that requires
features specific to each platform, then it would be less useful, maybe not useful at all. However, if it is a simple picture (and caption) that you want to post to all platforms, it would save time and effort by consolidating all of the platforms to one posting source.

## Features
The main feature this software would include would be the ability to take or upload pictures or videos, write a caption if one is desired, and then push that post to all the social media accounts connected to this software. The user would have to connect their media accounts one time upon making their account, then they would stay connected until changed or removed.

## Tools to Use
At this point, I am unsure of what tools would be best to make this possible. It seems like Python would be the easiest language to
use for this (focus more on figuring out functionality with an easier language than try to brute force it with a low-level language).

## Who Would Buy/Use This?
This would be a handy tool for social media managers or content creators with several social media accounts that they keep up with.
Although they might be used to the process, consolidating all of their media accounts or most of them to one place would save time and effort for them, allowing more time to relax or to create and post more content.
